Description
As part of the learning experience of developing cutting-edge solutions for problems in society, the task of developing a website for the computer science department has been assigned to me to build a good website for the department's use. The website encompasses a 10-page linked stack of web pages serving the purpose of providing vital information about the Department of Computer Science with the use of markup languages such as HTML and CSS with a reponsive base of JavaScript. The website is expected to be user-friendly and navigable as well as responsive and accessible across various devices. 

Instructions regarding cloning the website
Sign in to your GitHub account and use the search bar to find the repository by its name. Once located, click the 'Fork' button on the top right. Confirm the fork in the subsequent pop-up window.
In the git bash, use the "cd/path/to/yourdirectory" command to set the particular directory in which the clone is to be stored in. After that type in the the git clone command alongside the url of the forked repository. A git response would indicate that the code has been cloned successfully. 

Website Planning 
In order to begin working on my website i made use of a site map to outline the website's structure. This helped to visualize the connections between the different web pages. Find attached to the original code a diagram of the outlook i planned for the website.
Coding process
First commit: 
In my first commit, I attempted rendering the homepage with both html and css at the same time. In the course of programming, i found several bugs that plagued the functionality of my website homepage. Some problems included structural problems such as overlapping content, padding problems and in some cases technical bugs that seemed beyond my capacity as a novice. 
At the end of the first week, i submitted a mixed and fairly useless template that resembled an incomplete webpage as my homepage. 
The incomplete homepage was lacking in so many aspects that it was fairly useless for any form of added work. For this reason, restarted the project to solve the bottleneck.

New project 
I begun the new project by coding the structure of the web pages using html only. This eased the workload and narrowed my focus to structural functionalities and features rather than a split focus that had rendered the previous project difficult. In doing this i made use of an old principle in programming: DRY. Applying this principle meant that I was going to create reusable code templates that would make my coding process easier; these templates, i embedded into my pages using linking tags This templates increased the rapidity and scalability of code bases with which i rendered webpages.  

What I have learnt
Over the course of the project, I have been able to learn various techniques and methods of creating scalable codebases in the development of web pages. Also I have been exposed to various important skills needed by a web developer such as the use of version control systems(git to be precise) as well as its online counterpart github.
